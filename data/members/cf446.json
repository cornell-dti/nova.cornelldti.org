    "about": "I love working on software that solves real problems, whether it be on campus, in the fitness industry, or in social impact. I primarily work on back-end but love to explore new frameworks and tech stacks! Outside of tech, I am an RA on north campus and a huge (unfortunately) New York Knicks fan. I also enjoy reading and going to the gym in my free time.",
