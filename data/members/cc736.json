    "about": "Hey, I'm Cedric and I'm a senior information science major. I joined DTI as a designer on cue, our events app, sophomore year. Fast forward to the end of junior year, I was given the privilege of joining the leads team to head our design initiatives. Over the past two summers, I've spent my time at a startup designing for growth at Concord, a contract success platform, and understanding how marketing teams utilize data visualizations as part of Facebook's connectivity branch. Outside of school and design, Cedric's currently working to hop on a new fashion wave and trying to learn more about coffee!",
