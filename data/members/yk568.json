    "about": "I'm a Product Designer currently studying Information Science at Cornell University. I became more involved in design after taking a course at Cornell called \"Designing Technology for Social Impact.\"\n\nI love solving problems, coming up with awesome solutions, then sometimes discovering I was wrong, and going back to the beginning to solve the issue from a new perspective. \n\nTo me, design is like a game. A game which we can play with forever! A solution to a (design) problem will only be temporary, it will have to be solved again from a new point of view. Allowing us to play with it forever. I aim to learn from a diverse group of people, changers, influencers who love tackling challenges, share how to love others, and stay in bed with my dogs for as long as they allow me to.",
