    "about": "I am freshman freshman studying CS in Engineering. I really like riding bikes, as my picture probably suggests. When I'm not doing that I can be found in my room, or hopefully out socializing with other people. My other hobbies are photography and collecting fountain pens and listening to cool music. Oh yeah, I also enjoy coding things and messing around with computers. Probably why I'm here.",
