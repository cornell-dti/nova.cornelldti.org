At Cornell, I teach piano to undergraduates through the Cornell Piano Society and am also a member of the Cornell Symphony Orchestra and Cornell Hack4Impact. Outside of class, you can find me listening to 19th century Romantic music, reading Harry Potter, going on a run, or taking pictures of good food.",
