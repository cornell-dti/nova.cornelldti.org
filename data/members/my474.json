    "about": "I began coding when I was 13 years old and since then I have developed my skills through computational biology research, robotics, project teams, and free-lance web development. Through these experiences, I’ve developed an interest in robotics, machine learning, venture capital, front-end development and financial modeling. In addition, I’ve discovered the best code is written together and I love spending weekends planning and hosting collegiate hackathons with BigRed//Hacks or working with my team Cornell Design & Tech Initiative on campus.",
