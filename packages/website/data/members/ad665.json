    "about": "I am a sophomore computer science major in the college of engineering at Cornell. I've been programming since my early days of high school and DTI gives me the perfect opportunity to apply the knowledge I've gained in a way that can help those around me! Outside of school, I have an unhealthy obsession for bubble tea and (fried) chicken. In my free time, I like to explore new music, learn new card games, and catch up on lost sleep.",
