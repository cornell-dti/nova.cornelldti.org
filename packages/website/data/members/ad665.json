  "about": "Hi! My name is Ashneel and I'm a CS major + math minor in the College of Engineering. I love using software development to create meaningful impact on the lives of others, and DTI gives me the perfect opportunity to do so. Outside of school, you can find me fueling my addiction to fried chicken and bubble tea. In my free time, I like to explore new music, learn new card games, and catch up on lost sleep.",
