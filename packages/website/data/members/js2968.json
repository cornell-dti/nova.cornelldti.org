Aside from DTI, I am also a member of the Cornell Undergraduate Asia Business Society and the Singapore Students’ Association. I’m interested in all things technology and sustainability, and how businesses and organisations can harness them to raise the triple bottom line. Catch me honing my foosball skills at Okenshields, playing badminton or watching Masterchef and food vlogs while eating ramen!",
