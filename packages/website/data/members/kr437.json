I'm also intrigued by the idea of Smart Cities and using the Internet of Things to improve our current infrastructures. I've previously worked at BuzzFeed and PubNub as a SWE. Besides that I love exploring nature, doing pretty much anything spontaneous, traveling, listening to music and dropping my own fire mixtapes on Souncloud.",
