In my free time, I enjoy singing, sharing memes, and watching kdramas and cool movies (the whole range from superhero blockbusters to awesome thrillers like Get Out). Also, I am interested in creating tech for social good and recently participated in the 2020 Impact Fellowship! Wherever I am and in whatever I do, I hope to bring about a positive change and make some great friends along the way!",
