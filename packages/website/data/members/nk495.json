    "about": "I am a freshman majoring in CS in arts and sciences, but trying to transfer to engineering because strongly dislike the requirements. I am also part of the Wrestling Club, DGA, and the Cornell Hacking Club. I like biking, working out, exploring the outdoors, and eating junk food on weekends. I first got involved with DTI through the Propel program where my team was working on a campus scavenger hunt app called CornellGO! (check it out on the play/app store soon, please, it would help us a lot!). Now, we are working on the app as an unofficial part of DTI and trying to make it one of the main projects!",
