When I'm not hanging out in Duffield or designing something with too many gradients, catch me rock climbing, hiking, cooking, playing guitar, or looking at cute otters on Instagram. I'm also passionate about using tech for social good! Here's a shameless plug for some of my favorite orgs I've worked with:  https://risefirst.org/, https://cariclub.com/, https://hack4impact.org/.",
