    "about": "I love working on problems to make a positive social impact on communities around me. DTI allows me to do this while working with amazing people and developing my skillset as a designer, developer, and product manager. Outside of DTI, I also enjoy dancing on the Assorted Aces Dance Team and organizing events for the Product Management Club. When I need a break from the screens, I'm discovering new music, journaling, and exploring Ithaca with friends!",
