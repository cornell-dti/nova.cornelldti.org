    "about": "I love working on problems to make a positive social impact on communities around me. DTI allows me to do this while working with amazing people and developing my skillset as a designer, developer, and product manager. Outside of DTI, I also get to do what I love by dancing on the Assorted Aces Dance Team and organizing events for the Product Management Club. When I'm not working in eHub, I'm discovering new music, journaling, and exploring Ithaca with friends!",
