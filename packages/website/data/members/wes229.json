    "about": "Hey! I'm Will, a sophomore developer on DTI, and I love to spend my time coding and helping out the community. Besides DTI, I am involved with Girls Who Code on campus, where I help high-school students learn and appreciate the basics of programming. Besides developing, I spend my time gaming and following politics, so I can commonly be found yelling at my computer due to a broken controller or some scandalous news story.",
