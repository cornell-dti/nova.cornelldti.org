    "about": "I am a junior double majoring in information science and computer science (because I just love to make my life more difficult..). You can find me in the library or around campus, but I'll probably accidentally ignore you because I like to blast my music in my earphones and stare into space. You will definitely not find me at a gym, sorry.",
