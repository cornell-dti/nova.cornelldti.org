    "about": "Hey! I'm Megan Yin. I'm a CS student at Cornell with a minor in ORIE. I love creating user interfaces, analyzing data, and exploring the bleeding edge of web technologies. When I'm not working on stuff for DTI or trying to keep my GPA afloat, you can probably find me scrolling through relatable comics on Instagram, making memes, or just pondering the meaning of life (no the answer is not 42).",
