    "about": "Hi! My name is Vivian and I'm a senior studying Design and Environmental Analysis. As a Chinese American who grew up in Brazil, I have a passion for design that positively transforms the visual, built, and virtual environment. My blend of cultures offers me a unique, complex perspective that inspires my work. In the past, I have interned as a UX designer for Mastercard. On campus, you can find me doodling, building puzzles, playing the New York Times mini crossword and probably sipping on boba in Mann library.",
