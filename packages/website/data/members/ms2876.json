    "about": "I'm a senior English major, but I identify as the ampersand in Arts & Sciences. I love working an espresso bar, making far too many Spotify playlists, and dabbling in the intricacies of colloquial language. I'm also a member of Cornell Mars Rover and Science Olympiad at Cornell. I'm always looking for more niche academia, another stamp in my passport, and the best brie out there. And I'm always a sucker for bad jokes.",
