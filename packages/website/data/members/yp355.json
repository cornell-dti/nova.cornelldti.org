    "about": "Hello! My name is Michelle Park and I believe there is power in digital experiences that are designed for humans, by a human.\r\n\r\nI was born in South Korea, spent my childhood in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam, and then grew up in Irvine, California. I believe that my experiences in growing up in different environments shaped me into the empathetic and fast-adapting person I am today.\r\n\r\n I'm currently a senior at Cornell University studying Information Science with concentration on User Experience (UX). This past summer I designed at Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices working on multiple projects in healthcare technology.",
