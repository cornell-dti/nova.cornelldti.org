    "about": "Hello! My name is Michelle Park and I believe there is power in digital experiences that are designed for humans, by a human.\nI was born in South Korea, spent my childhood in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam, and then grew up in Irvine, California. I believe that my experiences in growing up in different environments shaped me into the empathetic and fast-adapting person I am today. \nThis past summer I ate lots of cake, explored new places by myself, sipped iced lattes, read books at a dog park, and went vintage store-hopping.",
