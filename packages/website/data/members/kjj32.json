    "about": "I am a senior studying electrical and computer engineering with minors in computer science and biomedical engineering. I really enjoy using the tools given to me in the form of technology to build something worthwhile for the community, and I have experience with low-level software, as well as building mobile and web apps. When I'm not busy juggling Cornell activities, I love to play video games, watch Netflix, listen to pop music, work out, and catch up with friends.\n",
