I am passionate about using design across mediums to create technology that is functional, accessible, sustainable, ethical, and makes positive social impact. On campus I'm involved in WICC, the Shakespeare Troupe at Cornell, URMC, and the Cog Dog Theatre Troupe. Outside of academic and project team work, you can find me acting in a show, attempting to pick up a new language, listening to music, or reading/writing poetry or prose.
