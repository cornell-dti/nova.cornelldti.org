    "about": "Hi, I'm Sam, and I'm a junior studying CS! In freshman year, I made a crazy decision to change my entire career path and pursue my love for tech. You'll definitely find me crying over psets at midnight, but I've never once regretted my choice. Outside of school, I love working on digital art, exploring new places with friends, and continuing to level up my shef skills. ",
