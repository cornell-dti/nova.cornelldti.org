    "about": "Hi, I'm Ashrita! I am a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in music and linguistics. I am passionate about using technology to create a positive social impact at Cornell. When I'm not working with my DTI subteam, you can find me with the Cornell Symphony Orchestra and Cornell Girls who Code. I also teach piano to students through the Cornell Piano Society. Some of my hobbies include listening to 19th century Romantic music, reading Harry Potter, going on a run, and taking pictures of good food.",
