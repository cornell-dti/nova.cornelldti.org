While my interests are in ML/AI and software development (full-stack & mobile), I am personally fascinated in investigating the connections between technology, deep learning, and education. I enjoy developing video games, playing the cello, and playing Planetside 2 in my free time. Come eat Chicken Udon Stir Fry at Okenshields on Tuesdays with me!",
