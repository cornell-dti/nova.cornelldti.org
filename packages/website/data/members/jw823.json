    "about": "I am a freshman studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering. I'm excited to explore creative ways to improve our community and beyond. On campus, I am an Alto 2 in Chorale, on the SWE grants committee, and a member of CTAS. When I'm not sleeping or napping, I'm probably learning about random things on Reddit, drinking vanilla lattes, making quality playlists, or binge-watching Rick and Morty. If you like blobfish, please talk to me.",
