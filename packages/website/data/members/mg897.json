    "about": "I am studying Computer Science and Business in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am an iOS developer on the Flux subteam and have been associated with DTI for over a year and a half now. I love being able to work with a group of like minded students to develop technology that would make campus life easier! Outside of DTI, I\u2019m also a Chair for Society of Women Engineers and the Tech Lead for Impact Investing at Cornell and Asha. When I\u2019m not working at Olin, you can find me exploring new places in Ithaca (as and when the weather permits), going on hikes or grabbing boba with friends. Feel free to reach out! ",
