I'm a freshman CS major hoping to learn about app+web dev and assistive technology. Outside of DTI, I'm also part of Science Olympiad, which I competed in while in high school. When I'm not crying about CS, you can find me playing Minesweeper and Tetris, binge-watching Bon Appetit videos, or jamming out to music ranging from classical to chiptune!","subteam":"carriage","otherSubteams":null,"website":null,"roleId":"developer","roleDescription":"Developer"}},"context":{}}
