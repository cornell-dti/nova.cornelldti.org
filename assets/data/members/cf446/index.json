I primarily work on back-end but love to explore new frameworks and tech stacks! Outside of tech, I am an RA on north campus and a huge (unfortunately) New York Knicks fan. I also enjoy reading and going to the gym in my free time.","subteam":"reviews","otherSubteams":null,"website":null,"roleId":"developer","roleDescription":"Developer"}},"context":{}}
