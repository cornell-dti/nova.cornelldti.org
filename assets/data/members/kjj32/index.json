I love making technology that can create a positive impact! That's why over the summer, I created an iOS app called Motivation Monday. It's a social media app focused on positivity by showing each user posts that motivate them specifically, and allows users to post inspirational things! You can find it on the app store now! Besides academics, I love to play video games, watch Netflix, listen to pop music, and explore the best restaurants and attractions in Ithaca!","subteam":"carriage","otherSubteams":null,"website":null,"roleId":"developer","roleDescription":"Developer"}},"context":{}}
