Obsessed with product, learning Figma, and on a quest to eventually understand how backend works. I love YouTube, learning about recent companies' decisions, and lists of three or more. Green is my favorite color, but think blue is an objectively better color. When I'm not studying or taking *way* too many credits, you can find me at Pokelava, with my friends or sleeping (in class or otherwise).","subteam":"samwise","otherSubteams":null,"website":"http://matthewepstein.me","roleId":"pm","roleDescription":"Product Manager"}},"context":{}}
