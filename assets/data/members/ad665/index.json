I've been programming since my early days of high school and DTI gives me the perfect opportunity to apply the knowledge I've gained in a way that can help those around me! Outside of school, I have an unhealthy obsession for bubble tea and (fried) chicken. In my free time, I like to explore new music, learn new card games, and catch up on lost sleep.","subteam":"flux","otherSubteams":null,"website":null,"roleId":"pm","roleDescription":"Technical PM"}},"context":{}}
