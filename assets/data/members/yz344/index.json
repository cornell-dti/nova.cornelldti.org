As both developer and designer I am actively involved in projects that develop cool products -- mobile apps, web apps, online game, etc. I have been a freelance illustrator since my entry to college and have recently collaborated with my favorite pop singer's concert team! I also design for Cornell Chinese Drama Society, Association of Computer Science Undergraduates, Cornell University Sustainable Design and some school magazines.","subteam":"flux","otherSubteams":["business"],"website":"https://dolphiwolfi.com","roleId":"designer","roleDescription":"Designer"}},"context":{}}
