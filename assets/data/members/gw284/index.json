In my spare time, I like playing video games (Fire Emblem :D), eating food or taking photos of chipmunks (when they're out and about on campus). In my time at Cornell I've worked on a lot of random projects, like a pong game controlled by joysticks and a piano game with physical buttons.","subteam":"queuemein","otherSubteams":null,"website":"http://guan.ninja","roleId":"developer","roleDescription":"Developer"}},"context":{}}
