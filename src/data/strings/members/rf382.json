    "about": "I am currently a junior studying applied economics and management with a concentration in business analytics! DTI stood out to me because it gave me an opportunity to explore my interests in tech outside of class and meet a great community of people who were passionate about helping others. But outside of academics, I love to dance, play tennis, and browse the sales section at Urban. And you can probably catch me at eHub in the AMs dancing wildly to my throwback playlist.",
