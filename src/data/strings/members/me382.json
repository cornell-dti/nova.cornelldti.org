    "about": "I am a Junior studying Computer Science and pursuing a minor in Business from the Dyson School of Business. I enjoy consumerism, YouTube, buying new electronics, and lists of three or more items. When I am not pretending to study or attempting to finish my homework, you can find me in my bed, at Cafe Jennie, or at Target. I am currently watching way too much food videos on YouTube, and I am searching for a new area of video entertainment to explore. If you see me on campus, please say hello! I love meeting new people (but need improvement on my name recall)!",
