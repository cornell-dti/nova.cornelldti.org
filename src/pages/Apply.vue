            Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke
            Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you.
            I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here!
            Where is he? Come on!<br><br> Let me see your identification.
            You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification.
            These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're
            looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business.
            Move along. Move along. Move along.<br><br> How did I get into this mess?
            I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in
            life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
            What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going
            that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you
            think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me.
            What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough
            of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted
            scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help,
            because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.<br>
